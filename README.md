## lightChain

Several days ago, I learned the blockchain techniques from the online lectures 
[Blockchain: techniques and applications](http://zhenxiao.com/blockchain/), taught by 
[Zhen Xiao](http://zhenxiao.com) from PKU. I was deeply attracted by the beauty of the 
underlying principles of the blockchain. To test the effect of learning, I build a light-weight 
blockchain (named lightChain) starting from scratch in this repo. When writing lightChain, I refer 
to several open-source projects such as the famous [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), 
the [bitcoin/bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) , and several guidance-oriented blogs 
(see references).


In lightChain, we basically use PoW for the mining of new blocks. I may add the implementation of 
PoS and some other variants in the future. It depends. :-)
