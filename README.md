## lightChain

Several days ago, I learned the blockchain techniques from the online lectures 
[Blockchain: techniques and applications](http://zhenxiao.com/blockchain/), taught by [Zhen Xiao](http://zhenxiao.com) 
from PKU. I was deeply attracted by the beauty of the underlying principles of the blockchain. To test the effect of 
learning, I build a light-weight blockchain (named lightChain) starting from scratch in this repo. When writing 
lightChain, I refer to several open-source projects such as the famous [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), 
the [bitcoin/bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) , and several guidance-oriented blogs (see references).


**To-Do List:**

--- | --- | ---
1 | Add the blockchain cores | 🛋
