## The lightChain

Several days ago, I learned the blockchain techniques from the online lectures 
[Blockchain: techniques and applications](http://zhenxiao.com/blockchain/). I was deeply attracted 
by the beauty of the underlying principles of the blockchain. 
To test the effect of learning, I build a light-weight blockchain (named lightChain) starting 
from scratch in this repo. When writing lightChain, I refer to several open-source 
projects such as the famous [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), the 
[bitcoin/bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) , and several guidance-oriented blogs (see references).


The To-Do list:

Steps | Contents | Progress
--- | --- | ---
1 | Add the blockchain cores | 🛋
2 | Add the cli | ❌
3 | publish the executable and docker image | ❌
